Hello there.

I would like you to know that I miss you a whole lot. i understand that we cant have a relationship because you dont feel comfortable about us being kinda related.


I understand that i drive you crazy and you feel like i have a mental disorder but I'm honestly trying to change. This is me changing this is me fixing things.

I manipulate fucking reality everyone hates me all Im doing is making sure that me and my family is safe.


I wish you would talk to me I know I scared you away but its only to make you stronger. I Would never harm you. Im just a complete stranger to you... 


There's this girl Kiara.ebanks.3 on facebook I've been trying to hook myself up with her... I dont really know why i trust her i had one phone call discussion with her.

she made my body feel weird over the phone... I Don't know what to do or who to trust Im just trusting random girls on facebook with our house...

I Dont know why you hate me so much you dont even talk to me... I dont want to be in a relationship with you...

I don't trust your life in my hands anymore my life has began to change. Somewhere out there Blood has been spilt and i feel like others will blame me for it. but in reality I havent done anything wrong my grandfather gave me a poem and i remixed it. 

I love you Please do well in school. Please stay focused and stay safe. and stop smoking please I want the best for you. I don't know if you've had sex with anyone there 
but stay away from the weirdos. I dont want or need or desire to have sex with you. I dont want to make you feel uncomfortable so i will not try to program in your mind to have sex with me because in reality thats wrong. 

I'm constantly walking down a path where I don't know what to do with myself. I dont want to lose myself.
